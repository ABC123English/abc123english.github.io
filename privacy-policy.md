# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: 1 May 2025**

At **ABC 123 Fun**, we prioritize the privacy and safety of all users, especially children. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data in accordance with laws such as **COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act)** and **GDPR-K (General Data Protection Regulation for Kids)**.

### Data Collection

**ABC 123 Fun** is designed to minimize data collection while providing a rich and interactive learning experience. Here's what we collect and why:

- **No Personal Information Collected**: We do not collect names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, or other personally identifiable information.
- **Technical Information for Support**: If you choose to provide feedback or report a problem, anonymized technical details such as:
  - App version  
  - Device model  
  - Operating system version  
may be collected to help resolve the issue.

- **Phonics Feature Audio Input**: Our phonics feature listens to alphabet pronunciation to guide and assist children in improving their speech. **No recordings are saved or transmitted**, and all audio data is processed locally on the device.

- **Anonymous Usage Data**: General analytics may be collected to improve app performance and user experience. This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify individual users.

---

### Parental Consent

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. Children can safely use the app under the supervision of a parent or guardian. No part of the app requires or encourages submission of personal data.

---

### Usage of the App

To function properly:
- An **internet connection** may be required to download new content or updates.
- **Tracing tools** are used only for English alphabets and numbers.
- Other educational content (such as grammar, days of the week, shapes, animals, good habits, and early math) is accessed through **games, visual aids, and listening exercises**.

### Children’s Privacy

ABC 123 Fun is primarily intended for children aged 4 and up. We comply fully with **COPPA** and other relevant regulations:
- No personal data is collected.
- Educational features are designed to protect children's safety and privacy.

If a parent or guardian believes that their child has submitted personal information without consent, they should contact us at **golearnenglishfun@gmail.com**. We will promptly delete any such information.

Even though we do not store personal data, we take security seriously:
- Secure access to downloadable resources.
- Regular review of systems for privacy compliance and potential vulnerabilities.
- Restricted app access to external links via **parental gates**.

### Third-Party Links

The app may include links to third-party websites (such as educational resources). These are protected by a **parental gate** and not directly accessible to children. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these third-party sites before interacting with them.

We are not responsible for the practices or content of any external sites.
